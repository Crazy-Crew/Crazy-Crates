  # How should we store Data?
  #
  # |  A not so readable but lightweight way to store user data such as uuids etc. Compressed! - Works out of the box.
  # |=> json (.json file) - A single json file compressed where all user data is stored.
  # |=> yaml (.yaml file) - A single yml file. It is only here to ensure compatibility for the time being.
  #
  # We currently do not support any other data type at the moment.
