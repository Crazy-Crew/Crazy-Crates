### Added:
- Added missing configurable messages to places around the plugin, all messages should now be configurable.
- Added a new config option where you can decide to send messages in chat or in the actionbar.
  - Messages that send a list to chat will by default never be sent to actionbar as it would not look pretty.

### Changes:
- If a message in the `messages.yml` is blank, it will not send the message.
