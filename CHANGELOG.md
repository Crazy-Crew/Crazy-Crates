## Additions:
* Added bstats back to avoid blimps in the bstats page.
  * If you wish to disable `bstats`, You can use the provided `bStats` to turn it off entirely. There is no need to provide a per plugin toggle as if you don't want it in one plugin, you don't want it in any of them.

## Fixes:
* Fixed an issue with an immutable error when doing /crates additem on a prize already existing.

## Minor:
* Updated outdated commands in default files.
* Removed unused or commented out code
