## Fixes:
* Fixed an issue where new players if the config option `Crate.StartingKeys` is not 0 weren't getting keys
  * While I was working on improving the FileManager... I forgot to uncomment this bit of code.

## Changes:
* Removed `unsupported-settings` from the example `config.yml`

## Minor Optimizations:
* Update the order some if checks go in to prevent potentially unnecessarily heavy calls when not needed.
