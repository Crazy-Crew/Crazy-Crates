## Fixes:
* Fixed an issue with casino crate where you could open a casino crate without the key.
* Temp fix for double message when trying to open a crate with key in off hand. This means for the time being, keys cannot be used in off hand.
  * A few changes will be made to how physical crate locations handle keys in the next 2 days in the `dev` branch with 2.1 builds so until then. This is the quicker solution..
